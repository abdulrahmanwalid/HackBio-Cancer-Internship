Machine Learning or ML is known as a discipline of artificial intelegence (AI) of which provides machines the ability to understand and automatically learn from the data that is being captured on daily basis to identify patterns and make predications for it.

Supervised Learning:

Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning that uses datasets of which are labeled to train algorithms to predict the outcomes and also used to understand the patterns found. Moreover, nowadays it is crucial and becoming normalized and efficient in healthcare and bioinformatics as it enables accurate predictions and classifications, such as diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and identifying genetic markers. By training on labeled datasets, these models can recognize patterns and correlations in complex biological data, aiding in as for example personalized medicine, drug discovery, and genomic analysis.

Case Study:

In a review article that was published in 2021, it was mentioned that various machine learning techniques have been utilized. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were to be employed in the majority of studies due to their ability to mimic human brain functions, adjusting weights through neuron layers to handle complex data like patient demographics and clinical records. Logistic Regression (LR), used in a smaller number of studies, offers a simpler model that predicts cancer probability based on factors such as age and lifestyle, making it easy to interpret variable relationships. Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs) are also applied, where DTs create flowchart-like structures for data segmentation based on risk factors, and RFs enhance prediction accuracy by combining multiple trees. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are utilized to map input features into a higher-dimensional space, identifying optimal boundaries to distinguish between individuals at risk and those not at risk of cancer.

Conclusion:

Supervised machine learning can actually enhance cancer prediction by the use of labeled datasets to train models that identify patterns and predict outcomes with high accuracy. It addresses current gaps by improving early detection through advanced algorithms that analyze complex data, such as patient demographics, medical history ,and genes. These models can uncover real correlations and trends that traditional methods might miss, leading to more personalized treatments. By continuously learning from new data, supervised machine learning also adapts to evolving trends in cancer research and this can refine predictions and improve diagnostic accuracy of those epaientss for the better lives.
